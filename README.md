# Fraud-Detection-Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset using various machine learning techniques.

## Progress
- **Data Exploration**: Completed initial data exploration and visualization.
- **Initial Models**: Trained and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) on the imbalanced dataset.
- **Balancing Techniques**: Currently implementing balancing techniques (SMOTE, class weighting) and evaluating their impact on model performance.

## Next Steps
- Finalize balanced model evaluations.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for the best performing models.
- Create detailed documentation and analysis of results.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis.
- `data/`: CSV file containing the dataset.
- `README.md`: Project overview and progress.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the analyses.
